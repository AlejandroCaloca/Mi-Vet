Mi-Vet is a practice management system developed for mid-size ambulatory veterinary practices. Our goal is to help veterinarians run more profitable and efficient practices, promoting better overall wellbeing for veterinarians and their patients!
Mi-Vet is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, only snippets will be provided here. This repository cotains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Dashboard feature.
